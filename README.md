# TamaGoDoWork

## Purpose 
TamaGoDoWork is a productivity tool that allows students to set goals, make to-do lists and plan out their weekly schedules. 
Heavily inspired by the virtual pet handheld game [Tamagotchi](https://tamagotchi.com/) and the android app, [Pou](http://www.pou.me/), TamaGoDoWork incorporates a virtual pet companion as part of its main features.
As students check off more daily tasks, they gain experience points which allows their virtual pet to grow.
Additionally, TamaGoDoWork is an application that can be used offline.
Students will be able to edit their to-do list even if they do not have access to the internet!

## Specifications
TamaGoDoWork is an application that is built specifically for Android devices only. 
The application is built using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore).
The application can only be used on phones that can support a minimum API level of 22. 

## Current plans
> TamaGoDoWork is still under development. 

Currently, our team has developed the **to-do list** and **login user system** for the application. 
In the next phase, our team will work on developing the **virtual pet system**. 

This requires us to: 
- Plan and design different stages of the virtual pet's growth.
- Incorporate virtual pet growth into the current XP system. 
- Develop pet interaction features. 
- Set up alarm and notification features.

## Future plans
Once our team is done developing our virtual pet system, we plan to work on the **weekly planner feature** in our application.
> We may also add some mini-games into our application if time permits!
